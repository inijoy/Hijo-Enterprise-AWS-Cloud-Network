# Hijo-Enterprise-AWS-Cloud-Network
This project documents the step-by-step process of building a secure and scalable cloud network infrastructure on AWS. The infrastructure is designed to host web applications and enable secure access from both internal and external sources using VPC, subnets, route tables, firewalls (NACLs &amp; Security Groups), and EC2 instances.
